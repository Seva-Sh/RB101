GOALS :
1) What does the code output and/or return
2) Why it happens
3) What concept does the example demonstrate

Practice Problems: Easy 1

On line 1 we initialize a local variable numbers and assign it to an array object
which contains integers 1,2,2,3
On line 2 we invoke the method uniq on local variable numbers. This mehtod invocation
returns a new array object where all the duplicates are removed

Line 4 prints the local variable numbers and returns nil


1 != is not equal comparison used to compare two variable and see if they
are asssigned to same objects
2 !var reverses boolean value of a variable or gives the opposite
of a boolean equivalent of an object
3 usually indicates a destructive method, in other words a method that mutates a caller
4 ?: if a ternary operator for if..else
5 ? at the end of a method means the return value of this method will be a boolean object
6 !! give a value of an object in a boolean form (true or false)
